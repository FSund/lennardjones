atom:
-position, velocity and force

state:
-vector of pointers to boxes
 -boxes constructed in state
-nBoxes

-vector of pointers to atoms (boxes has pointers to atoms)
 -atoms constructed outside of state???
-vector of moving atoms
-nAtoms, nMovingAtoms, nMatrixAtoms

-size of system
-size of boxes (same for all boxes)

-function for adding/removing atom
 -adding atom to the correct box
  -update nAtoms in box
 -update nAtoms etc

box:
-add/remove atom
-purge - remove atoms that are outside the box
 -return list of atoms that have left box

integrator:
-calculates forces, new velocities and positions, using chosen scheme

initializer/state manipulator
-load/save .xyz file
-generate initial state from parameters
-thermostat? (maybe separate class???)
-generate pores
-reduce density
